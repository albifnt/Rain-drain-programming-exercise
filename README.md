# Rain-drain-programming-exercise
<p align="justify">
An artist is setting up a collection of rain drains on a wall. From the top of the wall there is water
flowing down equally distributed along the complete edge. On the wall, there are several rain drains,
which capture water and release it on the right end.
Your task is to write a program, which calculates the amount of water flowing out on the right side of
a rain drain.

The program has the following inputs:

N... number of rain drains
<br><br>

For each rain drain, three values have to be provided:

H... height of the rain drain (integer)

L... left endpoint of the rain drain (integer)

R... right endpoint of the rain drain (integer)
<br><br>

One additional global parameter is requested as input:

amount... amount of water / length which is flowing down from the top edge. (double)
(For example a rain drain fully exposed to water from the top will release (R-L)*amount of water on
its right end)
<br><br>

The below picture is an illustrative example of how such a setup could look like. The numbers in the
picture indicate outflows on the right end of the rain drains.
